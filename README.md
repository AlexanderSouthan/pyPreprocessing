# pyPreprocessing
## General information
For preprocessing of datasets like Raman spectra, infrared spectra, UV/Vis
spectra, but also HPLC data and many other types of data, currently via
baseline correction, smoothing, filtering, transformation, normalization and
derivative. It relies on numpy, pandas, scipy, tqdm and scikit-learn, but also
on https://github.com/AlexanderSouthan/pyDataFitting for the introduction of
equality constraints into the polynomial baseline estimation methods, and
https://github.com/AlexanderSouthan/little_helpers.
